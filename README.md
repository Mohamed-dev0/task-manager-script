# task-manager-script
The goal of this project is to create a minimalistic, command-line task manager that lets you add tasks, list them, mark them as completed, and delete them. Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence, so they remain available even after restarting the application. This simple design demonstrates how to handle file operations, user input, and basic error handling in Python.
Below is a sample text in English that you can include in your README file to explain how to run the script, detail its features, and list any dependencies:

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder containing `todo.py`.
4. Run the script with:
    todo.py
5. Follow the on-screen menu to add tasks, list tasks, mark them as completed, or delete them.

## Features

- **Add a new task**: Prompt the user to enter a task description, then save it.
- **List tasks**: Display all tasks with an index.
- **Mark a task as completed**: Update a chosen task to indicate it’s finished.
- **Delete a task**: Remove a chosen task from the list permanently.
- **Data persistence**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`), so they remain available even after restarting the script.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3**: The script uses Python’s built-in libraries (`json` and others) and does not require any external packages.  
- No additional installations are necessary.
