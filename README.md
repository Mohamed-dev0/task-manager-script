# task-manager-script
The goal of this project is to create a minimalistic, command-line task manager that lets you add tasks, list them, mark them as completed, and delete them. Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence, so they remain available even after restarting the application. This simple design demonstrates how to handle file operations, user input, and basic error handling in Python.
